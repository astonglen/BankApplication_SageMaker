# BankApplication_SageMaker
End-to-End Project to build, train, and deploy an XGBoost classification model using AWS SageMaker through code making it a streamlined process.

This project is a personal project to understand how to navigate through the various AWS services through code. The outcome of the project is not necessarily the best. However, the end-to-end pipeline can be used for various projects avoiding redundancy.

Download the images and store them in the same directory as the notebook file to see the corresponding AWS console images on the Notebook file.
Make sure to change the bucket name in the code to be universally unique and follow the bucket naming convention.
Run the bucket creation step only once, then comment to avoid errors.
